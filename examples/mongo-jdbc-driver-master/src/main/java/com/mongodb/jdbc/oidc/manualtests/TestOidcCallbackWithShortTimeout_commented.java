********* AI-Assistant Documentation for - TestOidcCallbackWithShortTimeout_commented.java *********
This file contains a test class for validating the behavior of OIDC callbacks with a short timeout in the MongoDB JDBC driver. It aims to ensure that the system correctly handles timeout scenarios during user authentication.
