    "structural_analysis": "The file 'RFC8252HttpServerTest.java' is a JUnit test class designed to validate the behavior of the 'RFC8252HttpServer' class, specifically focusing on its handling of OpenID Connect (OIDC) callback responses. The class follows a standard structure for unit tests, utilizing annotations from the JUnit framework to manage test lifecycle methods and assertions. \n\n### Top-Level Types\n- **Class**: RFC8252HttpServerTest\n  - **Role**: This class is responsible for testing the functionality of the RFC8252HttpServer, ensuring it correctly processes OIDC callback requests and returns appropriate responses based on the input parameters.\n  - **Lifecycle Notes**: The class is not a singleton and is instantiated for each test run, ensuring isolation between tests.\n\n### Members\n- **Field**: server\n  - **Type**: RFC8252HttpServer\n  - **Visibility**: private\n  - **Purpose**: Holds the instance of the RFC8252HttpServer being tested.\n\n### Method Deep-Dive\n- **Method**: setUp\n  - **Parameters**: None\n  - **Return Type**: void\n  - **Behaviour**: Initializes the server instance and starts it before each test. Throws IOException if the server fails to start.\n  - **Internal Calls**: Calls server.start().\n\n- **Method**: tearDown\n  - **Parameters**: None\n  - **Return Type**: void\n  - **Behaviour**: Stops the server after each test to clean up resources.\n  - **Internal Calls**: Calls server.stop().\n\n- **Method**: testAcceptedResponse\n  - **Parameters**: None\n  - **Return Type**: void\n  - **Behaviour**: Sends a valid callback request to the server and asserts that the response code is 200 and the OIDC response contains the expected values.\n  - **Internal Calls**: Uses HttpURLConnection to send requests and server.getOidcResponse() to retrieve the response.\n  - **Key Control Flow**: Validates the response code and checks the OIDC response fields.\n\n- **Method**: testErrorResponse\n  - **Parameters**: None\n  - **Return Type**: void\n  - **Behaviour**: Sends a callback request with an error and asserts that the response code is 400 and the OIDC response contains the expected error details.\n\n- **Method**: testMissingParameters\n  - **Parameters**: None\n  - **Return Type**: void\n  - **Behaviour**: Sends a request without parameters and asserts that the response code is 404 and the OIDC response indicates missing parameters.\n\n- **Method**: testRedirectUnknownParameters\n  - **Parameters**: None\n  - **Return Type**: void\n  - **Behaviour**: Sends a request with unknown parameters and asserts that the response code is 404 and the OIDC response indicates the unknown parameters.\n\n- **Method**: testAmpersandInParameterValue\n  - **Parameters**: None\n  - **Return Type**: void\n  - **Behaviour**: Tests the server's handling of ampersands in parameter values, asserting the correct decoding of the state.\n\n- **Method**: testEqualsInParameterValue\n  - **Parameters**: None\n  - **Return Type**: void\n  - **Behaviour**: Tests the server's handling of equals signs in parameter values, asserting the correct decoding of the state.\n\n### Relationships\n- The test methods directly invoke the server's methods and validate the responses based on the HTTP requests sent to the server.\n\n### External Touchpoints\n- Utilizes JUnit for testing framework functionalities, including assertions and lifecycle management.\n\n### Observations & Caveats\n- The tests assume that the server is correctly implemented and running on the specified port. Any issues with the server implementation may lead to test failures.",
